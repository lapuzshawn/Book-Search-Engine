## Task

This week, you’ll take starter code with a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. 

It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end. 

## TO DO
To complete the assignment, you’ll need to do the following:

1. X Set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.

2. X Modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.

3. X Create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.

4. [ O ] Deploy your application to Heroku with a MongoDB database using MongoDB Atlas. Use the [Deploy with Heroku and MongoDB Atlas](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/deploy-with-heroku-and-mongodb-atlas) walkthrough for instructions.
